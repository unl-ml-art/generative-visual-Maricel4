# Project 3 Generative Visual

Your Name, yourcontact@unl.edu

## Abstract

Include your abstract here. This should be one paragraph clearly describing your concept, method, and results. This should tell us what architecture/approach you used. Also describe your creative goals, and whether you were successful in achieving them. Also could describe future directions.

Ever since I was a young child I have had very vivid and reoccuring dreams. I remember I struggled a lot with nightmares everynight and my mom told me about dreamcatchers. When I first heard the term I thought it was some sort of technology that would be able to capture visual stills from dreams and somehow print, project or portray them the next day on your wall for others to see. I wanted to tap into this idea with this final AI project. Through the use of cyclegan and text to image generation I wanted to tell the computer my dreams and have it recreate visually what I saw. I then want to add the analogue process of lumen prints to print out these collage images on. I wanted to use Lumen prints as my medium because they already have a dreamlike quality and like dreams themselves, images begin to get less clear and vivid as time goes on. If you do not fix a lumen print it disappears through prolonged exposure to the sun. 

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)
I included the inputs I used to generate my images.
I included the image outputs I used and the black and white inverted files.

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

I also used the Crane cyclegan code on Holland Computing Center.

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- move files (uploaded to youtube or vimeo due to github file size limits)
- ... some other form
I have included the process of making the analogue prints after the image generation is complete. The first image is the transparencies exposing on top of the film paper in the sun at innovation studio. The second and third are imagees of the final prints displayed for open studios. 

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
I really enjoyed the hotpot ai art maker. It was limited after awhile and did output the same kind of results after awhile. ALSO, innovation campus does not have the right kind of deep red light that is used in film dark rooms. Definitely if you want to do this find a darkroom that does so you aren't making your collages in the dark like I did.
